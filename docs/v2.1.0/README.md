# v2.1.0 release
The `v2.1.0` release is a significant update to the OCI Terraform Provider.

There were several major changes made under the hood.
But we have tried to minimize breaking changes on the surface in order to insulate our customers from too much churn.

[comment]: <> (TODO: Remove the following statement before release)
We are doing an beta release (`v2.1.0-beta`) for this version signaling our intent of minimizing customer impact in the face of big changes.

Please look at the documentation under this directory to see what facilities were [added](ADDED.md), which fields were [deprecated](DEPRECATED.md) and what bugs were [fixed](FIXED.md).
